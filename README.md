# Group Chat

## Overview
This program simple group chat where multiple users can communicate with each other on a server. I followed a tutorial online, (Credit to: @WittCode on YouTube) to develop this program. I made some tweaks and added a few new features. Overall, this exercise was to help me better understand how Java socket programming works.

## Goal
The goal of this program was to gain a better understanding of sockets and networking.

## Progress
Currently, the program only runs on the local machine, I might look back to this project to have it connect with other computers if I need practice.

## How to Run
First, run `Server.java` and give the group chat a name to start the server. Then, run `Client.java` for each chat member you desire. There is currently no member limit for the group chat. You can run commands in the client terminal for different actions (List members or send private messages). Type `\c` to list all the commands.
